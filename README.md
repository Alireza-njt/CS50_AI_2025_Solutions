[](./CS50AI_pll.png)

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets from CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python, an online course offered by Harvard University. The course covers fundamental AI concepts and their implementation using Python, including search algorithms, optimization techniques, machine learning, and reinforcement learning.

ðŸ“Œ Course Overview

CS50AI explores various AI techniques, focusing on:
	â€¢	Search Algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), A* Search
	â€¢	Knowledge Representation: Propositional Logic, Inference
	â€¢	Uncertainty & Probability: Bayesian Networks
	â€¢	Machine Learning: Supervised & Unsupervised Learning, Neural Networks
	â€¢	Optimization: Constraint Satisfaction Problems
	â€¢	Reinforcement Learning: Markov Decision Processes, Q-learning
	â€¢	Natural Language Processing (NLP): Tokenization, N-grams, Sentiment Analysis
